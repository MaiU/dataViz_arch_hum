# Notes Week 9 (March 23, 2018) - Final Project Overview

## Purpose
Data visualization pieces can be built for different purposes:
* To persuade or to make a point, as explanatory pieces.
* To allow the user to explore a dataset and get to their own conclusions
* Or as a combination of these two.

You need to choose which one of these you will develop, or how to combine both. The purpose of your data visualization should be very clear to you, and every element on your website should work towards this goal.

## Deliverables
At the end of the semester you will present the following elements:
* A fully functional website with a self contained data visualization project
* A full documentation of the project on your group's Github repository (through a `README.md` file). This documentation should include the following:
  * An explanation of the project and the decisions you made (analysis, graphic, coding, etc)
  * Sketches and process images showing the evolution of your design
  * An explanation of the dataset (including a link to the raw dataset)
  * Any other additional text or images you think are necessary
  * Source code
* Gif showing interaction with the data visualization piece

## Grading Criteria
Grading for the final project will be based on the following criteria (this part mostly follows the criteria set out by the [goodviz competition](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/competition/goodviz) at the [Data is Beautiful Sub-Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/)):
* Analysis: this means the data is treated and analyzed **carefully** and **correctly**.
  * The data is stratified or transformed correctly
  * The best units are used in the analysis (for example: "per capita", "by gender", "as percentage increase")
  * Transformations should be noted where possible
  * Clearly note when outliers are excluded
  * Clearly note when and why groups of data are excluded
* Display: this means that the data is presented **clearly** and **correctly**:
  * No misleading or mismatched axes or scales
  * Axes are labelled correctly, with units, where needed
  * The chart title/caption is plain and correctly describes the visual
  * The chart/post/title does not make generalizations based on outliers or anecdotes
  * There are no spatial errors within the plot
  * The right type of plot was picked for the data
  * Error bars are present where appropriate
  * No range/resolution issues are present
  * If transformed (e.g. log, semilog), the right transformation was picked and is marked clearly
* Aesthetic: this means that the whole site is aesthetically **interesting**, **cohesive**, and **elegant**:
  * The images is colorblind-friendly
  * No chartjunk is present
  * There are no excessive decorations, and the data-ink ratio is efficient.
  * There are no jpeg artifacts
  * No 3D effects were used
  * Animations are used only when necessary
  * The visual is high-effort and the author clearly took the time to process a quality visual
  * There is clear front-and-center presentation (the visual is not buried beneath a wall of text)
In addition, we will take into account the readings we have done during the semester to build an overall evaluation of the projects.

## Plan
* March 23: Datasets
  * Figure out what dataset(s) you will explore and the general topics of your projects
* March 30: Exploratory data visualizations:
  * Create a series of interactive graphs and charts that help explore your dataset(s). The idea here is to try to fully understand the structure and intricacies of your data, to see outliers, mean, median, average, deviations, and any other special characteristic of your data.
* April 6: Sketches and main idea
  * Create a series of sketches (hand drawn, Illustrator or code), to present the main idea behind your project. These sketches should describe your overall purpose, as well as the individual parts of your project. They should be as detailed and complete as possible.
* April 20: Working prototype
  * Present a working prototype of your project. All the main elements should be there, working well. This is your chance to get some final technical help and resolve bugs and minor issues.
* April 27: Final presentation
* May 7 or 8: Informal presentation at the Brown Center for Media Innovation
