### Assignment 6 - One Data Visualization - Adding Interactivity (Individual)
For this assignment you will need to add **interactivity** to your p5.js data visualization piece. You can also take this opportunity to improve your sketch, but the most important part will be adding a way for the user to interact with your visualization. Think carefully about what kind of interactivity you will create. Not just add buttons for the sake of adding buttons. Think about what is interesting in your data in the the graph or chart you've created and use interactivity to allow the user to gain a better understanding of your piece and of the data. That might be a button that highlights some aspects of the data, or a hover option that allows the user to see what values lie underneath your visualization. Or it can mean something different. Experiment and use interactivity to make your piece more engaging and illustrative.

As always, you should be able to justify every single pixel on the screen. Make sure the interactivity you code is intuitive and users don't need to decipher it to make it work. There are stablished standards and graphical elements that easily indicate interactivity, explore those and use them wisely. Even a lay person should be able to understand your piece and use it appropriately.

Finally, take a look at the p5.js [reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/). Here you will find all the functions that you can use as well as the documentation on how to use them.
