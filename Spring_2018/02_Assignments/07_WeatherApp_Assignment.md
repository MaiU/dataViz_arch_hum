### Assignment 7 - Weather App (Individual)
Using the OpenWeatherMap API build a weather app that will display the weather for any city based on user input.

Please think creatively about how to visualize weather data. Feel free to choose certain weather metrics over others, but think carefully about how to best represent the ones you choose. Do not just add them as text on the website. Instead, create your own graphic language, using shapes, text, layout and color, and make sure your new system of visualization is both engaging and understandable. Get inspiration from other weather apps out there, but don't be afraid to think outside the box and create a completely new way of representing weather information.

As always, think about the whole layout of the page, not just the piece that you are building. And think about every single pixel on your screen. Finally, don't forget to use the `p5.dom.js` library as well as the normal `p5.js` one.

#### Deliverables
* Upload your weather app to **your website** and submit a link to it via Courseworks.

#### Due date
Your link should be submitted via Courseworks before the end of **Thursday, March 29**.
