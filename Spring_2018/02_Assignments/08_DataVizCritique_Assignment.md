### Assignment 8 - Written Critique of Data Visualization Piece (Individual)
For this assignment you should write a 2 - 4 page (1,000 - 1,500 words) essay describing and critiquing an interesting data visualization piece.

The chosen piece needs to be a good, substantive, interesting work of data visualization. For ideas you can go back to the [blog](https://dataviz2018spring.tumblr.com/) or take a look at the list of projects at the end of the page. Feel free to also select something that's not there or on the blog. Just make sure it is a rich and interesting piece.

The idea of the critique is for you to describe the piece, analyze it, figure out what it is trying to do, how it is trying to do it, if it achieves it or not, and what its limitations are. The word critique doesn't only mean to find out what is wrong with something. It also means to understand the boundaries of something. So apply that to the visualization piece: what are its limits? What does it do well? How does it do it well? And where does it fall short?

Make sure you analyze and talk about the how as well as the what. The technical achievements are as important as how the data is treated. Does the visualization work for the type of data that it is visualizing? Does it work within the context of the data? And don't forget to analyze the political and social implications of the piece. Does it have an agenda? Is it biased?

Graphically, think about how the piece is built. Try to deconstruct it. How does the layout work? Does it have interactivity? Does it work well? What is the purpose of its interactivity? Who is the audience?

Finally, **you need to cite some of the readings that we have done during the semester**. Support your arguments with quotes from the readings and/or challenge the readings based on your findings from your analysis.

#### Deliverables
