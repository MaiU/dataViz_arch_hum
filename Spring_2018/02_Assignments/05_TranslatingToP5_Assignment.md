### Assignment 5 - One Data Visualization - In p5.js (Individual)
For this assignment you will need to improve and recreate your one data visualization piece **using p5.js**. Make sure you take a look at the comments I gave you on your piece and implement the changes you feel are necessary. Take this opportunity to understand how to create charts and graphs in p5.js, how to load data, and how to loop through it to create a visualization.

As always, you should be able to justify every single pixel on the screen. Work within the layout of your computer, and think carefully about fonts, titles, colors, font sizes, and your overall layout. Include a brief explanation of your piece and make sure you call out interesting moments in your visualization. Also, take some time to improve your website. Make sure all the links work and you can go back and forth between the different assignments and the home page.

Also, don't be afraid to pre-process the data. In fact, this is **highly recommended**. You DO NOT want to load the full dataset if you are only using two or three variables. Make sure you select only the data (columns and/or rows) that you are visualizing. Otherwise, you will risk making your visualization too heavy and your site might crash.

Finally, take a look at the p5.js [reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/). Here you will find all the functions that you can use as well as the documentation on how to use them.

#### Dataset
The data you will visualize is the PLUTO dataset for Manhattan, which contains data on every single lot in the borough. [Here](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/open-data/pluto_datadictionary.pdf?r=16v2) you will find the data dictionary with a description of every variable. This is an extremely rich and complex dataset so make sure you explore it carefully and read the documentation.

You can find the data files [here](https://github.com/juanfrans-courses/dataViz_arch_hum/tree/master/Spring_2018/02_Assignments/03_Assignment_03). I've broken them down by neighborhood and the codes for the neighborhoods (in the name of the file) are [here](https://github.com/juanfrans-courses/dataViz_arch_hum/blob/master/Spring_2018/02_Assignments/03_Assignment_03/NeighborhoodCodes.csv). You can choose to visualize one or multiple neighborhoods, or the whole borough. The files are `.txt` files and are `tab` delimited. You should be able to open them with Excel, Google Sheets or even Atom or Sublime (although I don't recommend these two for this task).

Feel free to transform the data, summarize it, filter it or extract meaningful statistics. You don't need to visualize the whole dataset or every single record (you can if you want, but you don't need to), but you do need to think about what story you are trying to tell.

#### Deliverables
* Upload your data visualization piece and your write-up to **your website** and submit a link to it via Courseworks.
* Your page should have:
  * Title
  * Visualization
  * Write-up
  * Link, back and forth, from your homepage.

#### Due date
Your link should be submitted via Courseworks before the end of **Thursday, February 22**.
